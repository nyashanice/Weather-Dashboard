# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard application is a useful application for many different occasions. Personally, I like to look at the weather before leaving my house for the day so that I can dress appropriately. Knowing the weather a few days in advance could also be helpful in other situations such as planning an event, going on vacation, etc. I built this application so that others could easy view the weather in different cities.

While making the Weather Dashboard, I learned more about local storage and how to use server-side APIs.

## Installation

To access the Weather Dashboard, click <a href="https://nyashanice.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/">here</a>.

## Usage

To use the application, type the name of any city in the search bar and click on the search icon. You will see the current weather in a big container on the page with the weather of the next 5 days below it! The weather will display the temperature in Fahrenheit, the wind speed in MPH, and the humidity as a percentage. Upon returning to the page, you will see your search history listed underneath the search bar.
